# Fibonacci
 - it is knowing as a sequence numbers that first number is 0 , second number is 1  and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th.
 - the function will took a number as integer n and return the nth fibonacci number
# solution 
 - return 0  when meet 1 ; return 1 when meet 2
 - return n-2 + n-1 num;
# complexity 
 - Time : O(2^N)
 - space: O(N)
